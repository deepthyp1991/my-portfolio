    "bio":"Coding was not my first IT destination. For me, achieving in milestones in testing have been important in preparing me for the coding challenges in Software development.\n Even though I earned Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering, I never had a chance to work as a developer. I have been a software tester doing my manual testing for few years and finally made a jump to developer.\nBy working as a tester, my eyes were wide open to find bugs, aware of all process. But at end of the day, I felt dissatisfied and empty thinking that I spent the whole day testing something that someone else has developed. I was always good at problem solving and finding solutions.\nI started looking into technologies to switch to. I finally found the sweet spot in JavaScipt. As, I went on learning, I started to do small projects to get hands-on experience. Nothing teaches you better than yourown mistakes. Keep making mistakes and correcting them. That’s, how I learned.\nI got an opportunity to study React JS from ComIT, where again I got a chance to learn new language. After doing a couple of projects in Front-end, I had eagerness to learn more about back-end and Database.\nI enrolled in Full Stack development course with Lighthouse labs. With 3 months of intense training, I worked on several projects (Front-end and Back-end). Each project was a challenge that I loved to solved in a logical way.\nI try to learn and get better every day. This journey is long and full of challenges and there is no destination, only milestones.",
